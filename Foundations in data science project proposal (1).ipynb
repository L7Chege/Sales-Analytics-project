    "Having a diet which is both sufficient in terms of energy (caloric) requirements and diverse to meet additional nutritional needs is essential for good health. Undernourishment, especially in children and mothers, is a leading risk factor for death and other health consequences. Therefore, I introduced an additional <u><mark>global hunger index</mark><u/> that can help answer questions around malnutrition deaths.\n",

    "Additionally, I can introduce <u><mark>world population data</mark></u> since if the mortality rate is high, the population growth rate becomes negative. Hence, as the mortality rate increases, the population growth decreases.\n",
    "Population change is governed by the balance between birth rates and death rates. If the birth rate stays the same and the death rate decreases, then population numbers will grow. If the birth rate increases and the death rate stays the same, then population will also grow.\n",
    "People living in a low-income country are far more likely to die of a communicable disease than a non-communicable disease. Despite the global decline, six of the top 10 causes of death in low-income countries are communicable diseases. Malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS all remain in the top 10.\n",

    "    \n",
    "GDP per capita increases the life expectancy at birth through increasing economic growth and development in a country and thus leads to the prolongation of longevity. During years of falling GDP, death rates rise by 0.4 deaths per 1,000 people (4% of the mean). Child mortality rates surge by 4 deaths per 1,000 births (6% of the mean).\n",
